					<p>What is the true story of Hua Mulan?<br />
<br />
This is a question many have asked but the answers are never satisfactory. Most people have been left with the impression that there is no evidence for her life. On the contrary, numerous clues have been left behind, all of which point to the fact that Mulan's story has a thread of truth in it. While historians doubt Mulan's existence due to the fact that her history cannot be <i>conclusively</i>&nbsp;proved,&nbsp;a diligent search for the historical Mulan reveals the touching true story of a girl who sacrificed everything for the sake of her ailing father and went on to become a legendary inspiration to countless generations around the globe.<br />
<br />
Although there are some uncertainties in the historical accounts, we can be reasonably convinced that this account of her life is true.<br />
<br />
Mulan's story is typically set during a time when the era of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixteen_Kingdoms">Sixteen Kingdoms</a> was drawing to a close and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Wei">Northern Wei</a> was rising to power. Thus, if we are to search for evidence of her life, we should begin our investigation by consulting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Wei">Book of Wei</a>, which is one of the most authoritative ancient texts on the history of Northern Wei.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
The Ballad of Mulan states that Mulan went to war and returned triumphantly twelve years later. Because it was not customary for Chinese rulers to conscript old and sick men, we would expect the beginning of Mulan's story to take place during a time when the emperor was preparing for an especially massive battle. Thus, if the story is true, we should expect to find historical records that a major campaign was launched, followed by a landslide victory twelve years later.<br />
<div>
<br /></div>
The most likely candidate for the year in which Mulan joined the army is 429 AD, when&nbsp;<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Taiwu_of_Northern_Wei">Emperor Taiwu of Northern Wei</a>&nbsp;launched a major attack against Rouran. This led to a series of campaigns, which concluded twelve years later when Emperor Taiwu united all of Northern China in 441 AD and brought the era of the Sixteen Kingdoms to a close.<br />
<br />
Shortly before Emperor Taiwu attacked Rouran, General Mu Chong, who was highly influential in the founding of Northern Wei, fell ill and retired from the army. While it is possible that the emperor allowed him to retire out of gratitude for his meritorious service, it seems strange that a general would end his military career at a time when a large-scale invasion was about to take place. Emperor Taiwu was a bloodthirsty warlord who won battles through attrition. It was not uncommon for him to suffer significant losses—up to half of his soldiers in a single battle—and then conscript additional men to make up for the difference. Because Mu Chong's retirement occurred during a time when one of the dynasty's most significant accomplishments lay on the horizon, the emperor would likely have rather seen him killed in action <b>unless someone had volunteered to take his place.</b><br />
<br />
While the Book of Wei does not mention any of Mu Chong's children who could have replaced him, 
 an investigation of the Northern Dynasties Surname Investigation (<a href="http://www.cnki.com.cn/Article/CJFDTotal-YWJY198511015.htm">北朝姓氏考</a>)&nbsp;reveals that there was a daughter of the Mu family whose name was Mu Lan.<br />
<br />
Could Mu Lan have been the filial daughter who later became the legendary hero we now know as Mulan? Even though Mu Lan is a full name and Mulan is a given name, 
their pronunciations are identical. In a society where only the elite could read and write, the two would easily be confused. More importantly, Mulan (木蘭) is a Han Chinese name while Mu Lan (穆蘭) is a Xianbei name.<br />
<br />
<br />
<figure><img border="0" data-original-height="490" data-original-width="626" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EIiCZHUyIEA/XRxGGSGX67I/AAAAAAAAACY/UnKDWmE1TTIbHlYiA6cfqi0klIcVOREiACLcBGAs/s1600/Bozhou_Mulans_birthplace.png" /><figcaption style="text-align: center;"><i>A house in Bozhou, Mu Lan's birthplace. Included in a late reprinting of the Bozhou Zhi.</i></figcaption></figure>
<br />
The Xianbei were once a nomadic people who, before conquering China, dwelt in what is now present-day Mongolia. The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Jin_dynasty_(265%E2%80%93420)_and_the_Sixteen_Kingdoms_(304%E2%80%93439)">fall of the Jin Dynasty</a>&nbsp;ushered in the era of the Sixteen Kingdoms, which was one of the darkest and most turbulent times in China's history. Eventually, the Xianbei rose and subdued the Chinese.<br />
<div dir="ltr">
<br /></div>
<div dir="ltr">
Even though the Xianbei were in power during this time, the Han Chinese people far outnumbered the Xianbei. As the legend of Mulan was passed down from generation to generation, the Chinese people, who were in the majority, would have naturally chosen to depict Mulan as one of their own. Thus, when the legend was finally written down, the Chinese name was chosen.</div>
<div dir="ltr">
<br /></div>
<div dir="ltr">
Even if Mulan's ethnicity was Xianbei and not Han Chinese, this doesn't change the fact that she was an incredibly filial daughter who left an inspiring example for us to follow. Even though there existed much tension between the Han Chinese and Xianbei people, Emperor Taiwu, in his thirst for power, oppressed everyone equally. Because he had no problems with sending Xianbei men to their deaths, the story of a woman needing to take her father's place to save his life works equally well no matter what the heroine's ethnicity was. Even if Mulan was Xianbei, she remains a hero to be honored by every culture.<br />
<br />
While this attempt to reconstruct Mulan's life may seem highly speculative at first, we will soon see that there is more evidence to support this version of Mulan's story than other retellings which have gained popularity in recent years.<br />
<br />
Let us take a look at <i>The Ballad of Mulan</i>. If we reread this familiar poem through Mu Lan's eyes, we will see a whole new story emerge. The author and date of the <i>Ballad</i>&nbsp;are unknown, although it is typically assumed to have been written during the Tang dynasty (which would mean that it was penned over a century after Mu Lan's death). However, it is very possible that it could have been composed much earlier.<br />
<br />
Cao Xi from Qiqihar University argues that the <i>Ballad</i>&nbsp;was authored by Mu Lan herself (<a href="https://books.google.com.tw/books?id=01ZyDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA82">木蘭辭新考</a>). Being that she was from an elite family, she would have known how to write, enabling her to leave the <i>Ballad</i>&nbsp;behind to be discovered later; it is also possible that she uttered these words in the presence of a large crowd. Either way, the <i>Ballad</i>&nbsp;became a sensation and countless people across China began repeating these touching words.<br />
<div>
<br />
A memorial to Mulan has been engraved into a large stone located on Mulan Mountain in Hebei, China. The memorial comments that the&nbsp;<i>Ballad</i>&nbsp;was, in fact, composed during Mulan's lifetime, calling it "Mulan Ci."<br />
<br />
There are two names for the Ballad of Mulan in Chinese: Mulan Shi (木蘭詩) and Mulan Ci (木蘭辭). This difference in naming has been largely ignored by people who assume that Shi and Ci have the same meaning. On the contrary, they are very different.&nbsp;<b>In every Ci throughout Chinese literature, the poet is claiming to write an autobiography.</b>&nbsp;Although there are many Ci where modern scholars doubt that the author is actually writing about himself, it is never contested that the poet at least claims to be the central figure of his own poem. The only exception to this rule is the&nbsp;<i>Ballad of Mulan</i>.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the reason why historians have been unable to determine the author and date of the&nbsp;<i>Ballad</i>&nbsp;is that the author has been hiding in plain sight this entire time.<br />
<br />
<br />
<figure style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<img class="fillimg" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dNmXPQz1Avc/XRmnTkIJnQI/AAAAAAAAAB0/Qx-pD0ewIrkniKyvr48cr0GAiFc3H8NBgCLcBGAs/s1600/0823dd54564e9258fffede129582d158cdbf4e07.jpg" /><figcaption style="text-align: center;"><i>Modern-day Mulan Mountain</i></figcaption></figure><br />
After Mu Lan composed the <i>Ballad</i>,&nbsp;people were so moved by this poem that they began passing it down in oral form for nearly a century before it was finally preserved in written form during the Tang dynasty. Before it was collected into the musical records, it is very possible that several alterations may have been made. In addition to the name Mu Lan changing to Mulan, another important alteration may have also been introduced.<br />
<br />
Mu Lan's father passed away in 430 AD, the year after she joined the army. Thus, her sacrifice was in vain. However, the conclusion to the&nbsp;<i>Ballad</i>&nbsp;describes Mulan meeting the emperor. She declines his offer of a prominent position, only requesting to be reunited with her parents. Because her father had already passed away by the time Mu Lan returned from battle, the joyful conclusion to the <i>Ballad</i>&nbsp;must have been added.<br />
<br />
How did Mu Lan's story actually end?<br />
<br />
During the Ming dynasty, historian&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhu_Guozhen_(Ming_dynasty)">Zhu Guozhen</a>&nbsp;commented on Mulan's story, revealing a tragic ending. Zhu Guozhen wrote a collection of reports on various civil and political issues, compiling them into a work which he titled&nbsp;<i>A Minuscule Book from the Yongzhuang Studio</i>. This book has been praised by modern historians (such as <a href="http://cdmd.cnki.com.cn/Article/CDMD-10476-1012420931.htm">丁富信</a>) for taking great care to preserve historical details.<br />
<br />
One particular topic which Zhu Guozhen addressed was that of woman soldiers, heralding Mulan as an exemplary woman who fought valiantly and defended her chastity with all her might. Zhu Guozhen wrote:</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
When the royal court finally heard about Mulan's true nature, the emperor offered her a position in the royal harem. Mulan declined, saying, "Your humble servant is unworthy of this honor." When the emperor tried to take her by force, she realized that she was unable to resist his demands. Thus, she ended her own life.
<span style="font-size: xx-small;"><br /><br />
<a href="https://archive.org/details/02096876.cn/page/n31">Original Chinese text</a></span></blockquote>
<br />
Sadly, this tragic conclusion makes sense. The emperor under whom Mu Lan served had no respect for human life, caring only&nbsp;about his conquests. This same ruler, upon discovering that she was a woman, would not have shown any respect for her. It would be consistent with his depraved nature for him to desire to have her for himself.<br />
<br />
After Mu Lan returned home from war, she was summoned to appear before the emperor. Rather than being rewarded for her valiant service,&nbsp;a nightmare began unfolding before her very eyes as she learned that she was about to be taken as a concubine.<br />
<br />
There, in the royal court, Mu Lan began to utter the harrowing words which we now know as the <i>Ballad of Mulan</i>. These words must have been burning in her heart ever since she heard of her father's passing. Although it is possible that the conclusion to the <i>Ballad</i>&nbsp;was modified long after her death, I think it is very possible that she introduced the alteration herself. Standing defiantly in front of the emperor, she told of how she ought to have been rewarded for the years she spent serving in the emperor's army. Even so, she had no desire for acclaim. The only thing for which she truly longed was to be reunited with her parents. As she finished uttering the final words of this poem, she took her own life.<br />
<br />
This explains the emperor's sudden change of heart which Zhu Guozhen records:<br />
<blockquote>
Greatly moved, the emperor posthumously promoted her to general and added "filial" to her title.<span style="font-size: xx-small;"><br /><br />
<a href="https://archive.org/details/02096876.cn/page/n31">Original Chinese text</a></span></blockquote>
<br />
The emperor, whose conscience had already been seared, would not have been moved by a woman's death. He had already grown accustomed to slaughtering countless soldiers on a regular basis. Rather, he was trying to save face.<br />
<br />
As the <i>Ballad</i>&nbsp;swept across the country, the Chinese people were both alarmed and inspired by Mu Lan's story. Despite his best efforts, the emperor found himself powerless against the spread of this touching poem which condemned his tyranny. He promoted Mu Lan and may have even ordered that her story never be recorded in any official form in hopes that he would cease to be perceived as a monster. Still, the <i>Ballad</i>&nbsp;continued to spread.<br />
<br />
The real story of Mulan is not a tale of war. It is not about a woman who defies gender stereotypes and proceeds to single-handedly save China from the barbarians. Rather, the true story of Mulan tells us how a woman pitied her father and was willing to renounce the world in order to save him from the emperor's cruel orders. Even though her sacrifice proved to be useless, she refused to be overcome with grief. When the emperor was shamelessly titillated by her story, she resisted his tyranny in bold defiance.<br />
<br />
The true story of Mulan is an empowering tale of a woman who simply refused to give up.<br />
<br />
When her world came crashing down around her, she persevered.<br />
<br />
Mulan is the hero this generation needs.
